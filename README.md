# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile

## 🌐 Project Overview 

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing disease symptoms and patient profiles. The main objectives are to understand the distribution of patients across various demographic groups, explore the distribution of diseases, and examine the relationships between symptoms, medical factors, and disease incidence. 

## 🎯 Project Objectives 

1. **Understand the distribution of patients across different demographic groups (age and gender).**
2. **Explore the distribution of diseases in the dataset and identify the most common diseases.**
3. **Explore the relationship between symptoms (Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Breathing Difficulty) and disease incidence.**
4. **Evaluate the impact of medical factors (Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Level) on disease diagnosis.**
5. **Understand the distribution of positive and negative disease diagnosis results and assess the overall success rate of disease diagnosis.**
6. **Provide recommendations for further analysis or research based on EDA findings.**

## 📝 Summary of EDA 

### 📈 Demographic Distribution 
- **Average Age**: 46 years
- **Age Range**: 19 to 90 years
- **Dominant Age Category**: Middle Age (40-59 years)
- **Diseases by Age**:
  - **Youngest Patient**: Influenza (19 years)
  - **Oldest Patient**: Stroke (90 years)
  - **Middle Age Category**: Asthma, Chickenpox, Coronary Artery Disease

### 🚻 Gender Distribution 
- **Female Patients**: 176 cases (50.4%)
- **Male Patients**: 173 cases (49.6%)

### 🩺 Disease Distribution
- **Common Diseases**: 240 cases (68.8%)
  - **Top Common Diseases**: Asthma (23 cases), Stroke (16 cases), Osteoporosis (14 cases), Hypertension (10 cases), Diabetes (10 cases)
- **Rare Diseases**: 109 cases (31.2%)
  - **Examples of Rare Diseases**: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Hypoglycemia, Fibromyalgia, Eating Disorders, Williams Syndrome

### 🤒 Symptom Distribution
- **Fever**: 175 reports
- **Cough**: 167 reports
- **Fatigue**: 242 reports
- **Difficulty Breathing**: 88 reports
- **Most Common Symptom**: Fatigue, followed by Fever and Cough
- **Least Common Symptom**: Difficulty Breathing

### 🏥 Medical Factors
- **Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels**:
  - **Healthy Patients**: Normal levels
  - **Unhealthy Patients**: High levels
- **Diagnosis Results**:
  - **Positive for Disease**: More patients diagnosed positive than negative

### 📌 Recommendations
Based on the correlation analysis, it is recommended that patients:
- Maintain and monitor blood pressure and cholesterol levels
- Pay attention to age and personal health factors, especially when experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing

## 🎉 Conclusion

This EDA provides valuable insights into the distribution and relationships of disease symptoms and patient profiles. The findings can guide further analysis and research aimed at improving patient health outcomes.
